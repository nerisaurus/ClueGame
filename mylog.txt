* Fixed silly console printing error.
* Cleaned up test (using assertTrue/assertFalse rather than assertEquals(true... etc.
* testAccusations now passes (although I had to fix a misplaced index in the process)
* testAccusation() failing test implemented.  Also, fixed spelling of Venus in rooms file.
* Made solution into a Solution.  Added Solution class logic as needed.
* Changed test logic to avoid emptying deck prematurely.  All tests pass.
* Changed player names (and adjusted tests to match).
* Removed players.csv to use just one file for players as cards and as actual players.  Also, logfile might still be causing issues...
*   Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/nwunder/ClueGame

| * working on solution
| * failing test to see if there is a good solution
| * passing allCardsAreDealt test. well commented method too :-P
| * failing test written to make sure all cards have been dealt.
| * change deck to a LinkedList to check that specific contents are read from file.
| * passing setup deck test
| * card csvs. the person card list is generic. needs a touch of creativity
| * Two thing here: 1-creating human/computer players and 2-failing test for the deck of cards.
| * refactored to use java Color lib
| * passing load players test
| * failing test for loading players.csv
| * created a generic players.csv. needs a creative overhaul
| * Start positions identified. Each player is at least a D6 away from entering a room.
| * GameSetupTests beforeClass setup done
* | Nothing to commit here.

* class stubs
* cleaning up the clueGame package, removing unused libs, cleaning up var names
* removed warning from board tests. renamed cludBoardTests package to lowercase c.
* trying to ignore ubuntu temp files
* removing ubuntu temp files
* trying to ignore ubuntu temp files
* all tests green
* cleaning up target tests. mostly there
* Working on buggy target logic
* Overhauled calcAdjacencies logic.
* Improved walkway detection logic.
* all CR tests pass after some refactoring
* replaced all test files and board files with our own
* filled in idea
* second attempt
* No need to clutter code with a lot of repeated calls to calcIndex.  Made a cell variable to keep track of the current cell we're looking at - since we call it so often.  It might be worth it to make 'up', 'down', 'left','right' as well, if they are used so prolifically
* sample fix for calculateAdjacencies
* ignoring log.txt
* Fixed call to nonexistant legend file.  Now only one test fails, and it fails due to a failure rather than due to crashing.
* Many renamed variables and functions (to make tests and actual code match and to clear up ambiguities).  Removed calcTargets(row,col,steps) and made setupTargets into startTargets(row,col,steps).
* renamed clueBoard package to clueGame packed per CR tests.
* replaced CR tests. removed mac token files...need to update .gitignore file
* removed duplicate test files
* git repo is now an eclipse project
* refactored loadBoardConfig
* Added missing files
* Initial Commit
