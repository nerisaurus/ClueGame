| * Added double functionality for legend label coordinates (mostly to have -.5's, so things center slightly better.  This needs the Double vertical and Double horizontal method variables.
* | getting some tests to pass

|/|   
* | Tweaks to variables for aesthetic purposes.
* | Added player drawing logic.  Player class now has a draw function (and I renamed startingRow and startingColumn to row and col, since those variables still hold location once the player moves - just a little thing that was bugging me).  Board gets passed the list of players when it is created in ClueGame (via setPlayerList or something like that), and Board.paintComponent draws all players.
* | Made ClueGame setSize base itself on the board's size.  However, this is too small for some reason.
* | Now with TECHNICOLOR (we make no claim to astronomical accuracy)
* | Minor graphical changes.
|/  
* Resizing.
* Board fixed.  getHeight and getWidth replaced with method names which don't override anything.
* Adjusting size, description text, etc. in Detective notes.  Might as well make the probably-not-necessary logic I wrote up look fancy.
* Finished logic to update the 'best guess' parts of the Detective notes (again - this is all in SuspectsPanel now). ...and, just as I have a really elegant and powerful system working (including an 'Unsure' option which appears whenever there are more than 2 possible suspects)... I take another look at the requirements and, well, it doesn't look like the code actually had to do anything after all.  Oh well, our code is awesome, at least.
* Reduced the three detective subpanels into one: SuspectsPanel

| *   Added Space Station drawing logic.  Cannot test appearance due to larger board display errors.
| |\  
| * | Started making logic for doorway drawing. Still can't find why board doesn't display correctly.
* | | added combo boxes. just needs some logic to get suggested play working
| |/  
|/|   
* | all three check box panels up
|/  
* people panel is working. constructor issues, it was working as a test but not as an app. needed to beef up the constructor to call setup methods
* changed constructor call to match constructor call in tests
* adding files that git commit -a -m didn't add git add -A
* added call to new board in default constructor
*   Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/nwunder/ClueGame
|\  
| * Added draw functions for RoomCell and WalkwayCell, which use cellDimensions to size themselves and the BoardCell color to fill in the proper color.
| * Added panelHeight and panelWidth (with appropriate getter methods) to the Board class.  These are integer values.  There is also a cellDimensions integer variable which is used to calculate these.
| * Made an abstract method draw in BoardCell.
| * loadBoard now pushes the color (from the legend) to BoardCells when they are created.
| * Color changes.
* | adding a call to board. needs code to work though (with i just need to pull)
* | detective notes dialog pops up
* | basic JFrame running in ClueGame. simple menu added.
|/  
* Removed an unnecessary function (previously used to check stuff for debugging
* I was an idiot with Linked Lists.  Fixed that.
* Removed the print line from GameActionTests - it was annoying me (even though I think I was the one who originally put it in).
*   (re)Fixed test (accidentally undid an important change in one of my tests)
|\  
| * conflicts resolved
* | Just to get git to cooperate

* Fixed conflicts in ComputerPlayer
* conflict mess part 1
*   fixed conflicts
|\  
| * passing test ClueGame will look though a linked list of players for suggestions
| * failing test to look at all players in the game to find a matching suggestion
| * moved disproveSuggestions method to the player class from humanPlayer. I guess humans can't pick which card to reveal.
| * passing test for picking a random card. needed to fix test to only get one random card each time through the loop. altered test logic too.
| * failing test to see that the player picks a random card
| * passing first disprove human test
| * updated test to only look at human player for now
* | Tests for making suggestions now pass.  If git let me use exclamation marks, I would use them here.
* | Moved a lot of logic from Player into the subclasses.  Tests still pass as before.
* | Failing tests for making suggestions finished.
* | Tests for making suggestions added.  Still figuring out setup logistics - so these aren't the finished failing tests yet.
* |   Merging in the target tests.
|\ \  
| |/  
| * oops fixed call to constructor
* | Added logic to reset lastVisited upon visiting a new room.  All target tests pass.
* | Typo in test. No longer throws error (but still fails - progress)
* | Targeting logic added.  Randomness passes the test, but it's room priority seems to be causing errors.
* | Bugfixes and initial work on pickTarget logic (still fails tests)
* | Cleaned up tests (and split into two, for clarity). Still failing, since no changes have been made to the main code.
* | Failing target tests implemented.
* | Minor changes to set up for test.  Adding useful getters to Player, ClueGame, etc.
|/  
* first failing disprove suggestion test
* Fixed silly console printing error.
* Cleaned up test (using assertTrue/assertFalse rather than assertEquals(true... etc.
* testAccusations now passes (although I had to fix a misplaced index in the process)
* testAccusation() failing test implemented.  Also, fixed spelling of Venus in rooms file.
* Made solution into a Solution.  Added Solution class logic as needed.
* Changed test logic to avoid emptying deck prematurely.  All tests pass.
* Changed player names (and adjusted tests to match).
* Removed players.csv to use just one file for players as cards and as actual players.  Also, logfile might still be causing issues...

| |/  
| * working on solution
| * failing test to see if there is a good solution
| * passing allCardsAreDealt test. well commented method too :-P
| * failing test written to make sure all cards have been dealt.
| * change deck to a LinkedList to check that specific contents are read from file.
| * passing setup deck test
| * card csvs. the person card list is generic. needs a touch of creativity
| * Two thing here: 1-creating human/computer players and 2-failing test for the deck of cards.
| * refactored to use java Color lib
| * passing load players test
| * failing test for loading players.csv
| * created a generic players.csv. needs a creative overhaul
| * Start positions identified. Each player is at least a D6 away from entering a room.
| * GameSetupTests beforeClass setup done
* | Nothing to commit here.

* class stubs
* cleaning up the clueGame package, removing unused libs, cleaning up var names
* removed warning from board tests. renamed cludBoardTests package to lowercase c.
* trying to ignore ubuntu temp files
* removing ubuntu temp files
* trying to ignore ubuntu temp files
* all tests green
* cleaning up target tests. mostly there
* Working on buggy target logic
* Overhauled calcAdjacencies logic.
* Improved walkway detection logic.
* all CR tests pass after some refactoring
* replaced all test files and board files with our own
* filled in idea
* second attempt
* No need to clutter code with a lot of repeated calls to calcIndex.  Made a cell variable to keep track of the current cell we're looking at - since we call it so often.  It might be worth it to make 'up', 'down', 'left','right' as well, if they are used so prolifically
* sample fix for calculateAdjacencies
* ignoring log.txt
* Fixed call to nonexistant legend file.  Now only one test fails, and it fails due to a failure rather than due to crashing.
* Many renamed variables and functions (to make tests and actual code match and to clear up ambiguities).  Removed calcTargets(row,col,steps) and made setupTargets into startTargets(row,col,steps).
* renamed clueBoard package to clueGame packed per CR tests.
* replaced CR tests. removed mac token files...need to update .gitignore file
* removed duplicate test files
* git repo is now an eclipse project
* refactored loadBoardConfig
* Added missing files
* Initial Commit
