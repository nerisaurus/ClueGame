* handleSuggestion now only updates suggestion log if commanded to (mostly so that tests which are checking for its logic don't have to also create the suggestion log and all the GUI stuff that goes with that)
* Added Disproved info in log.  Some word wrap to deal with, but we just need to change the size a little to deal with that.
* Removed syso

| * Colorful Suggestion Log!
* | One more compliance thing: a short term fix for Accusations.  Now, when 'accuse' is pressed, targets are highlighted again.  Later, this would only be the action of the 'cancel' option for accusations, but we haven't added that button yet.
|/  
* If the player clicks on an invalid target, they are told so. I think this is a bit spammy, but it's in the requirements.
* Timer works. O_O  A lot of the logic has been moved from EndTurn to the timer itself.  Can you take care of that printline statement somewhere?
* Fixed tests (we switched x,y/y,x yet again... so another round of swapping all the columns and rows in the test setups)
* Smartened AI.  Now it can make better accusations.
* Cleared up a few more TODO's.  Opening the accusations panel will now remove the board highlights (once we put a cancel option to the makeAccusations dialog, that should rehighlight the board).  AI handles a few things more gracefully.
* Quick addition to the handleSuggestion - it now should also handle suggestions that have not been disproven.
* Got a few TODO's cleared up.  The starting player is properly displayed on the first turn.  Suggestions are properly added to the log (although that could use some cleaning up).
* Computer players now will always move when they have moved (that is, they always update their location now).
*   addSuggestion(Player accuser, Solution suggestion, Card disprovingCard) function added to SuggestionLogPanel class - describes the suggestions and adds them to the scrolling text.

* Merged Panels into one class
* One last bit: checking for humans who enter rooms.
* Even more background logic added.  There's still a lot of little bits and pieces to put together (especially in regards to actually updating the GUI panels, since I don't have those to touch yet), but it should be fairly straightforward (see all the TODO's for more info).
* Added some Button clicking logic.  No listeners yet, but the functions that the listeners can call to do their dirty work.  Player is now an abstract class.
* Added isValid____ methods for BoardClick, EndTurn, and AccusationTime.  Thus, when making action listeners, we can just call one function to check whether the button's actions should be carried out (they also give dialogs to the reader informing them why certain actions are invalid).  I also neatened the instance variables of ClueGame and added a bunch of boolean tags for game flow logic all in one spot.
* Fit window size the better - not going to break later - way.
* Fit window size the almost good way.
* Started on some turn logic - highlighting, dice roll helper method.

* | Tweaks to variables for aesthetic purposes.
* | Added player drawing logic.  Player class now has a draw function (and I renamed startingRow and startingColumn to row and col, since those variables still hold location once the player moves - just a little thing that was bugging me).  Board gets passed the list of players when it is created in ClueGame (via setPlayerList or something like that), and Board.paintComponent draws all players.
* | Made ClueGame setSize base itself on the board's size.  However, this is too small for some reason.
* | Now with TECHNICOLOR (we make no claim to astronomical accuracy)
* | Minor graphical changes.

* Resizing.
* Board fixed.  getHeight and getWidth replaced with method names which don't override anything.
* Adjusting size, description text, etc. in Detective notes.  Might as well make the probably-not-necessary logic I wrote up look fancy.
* Finished logic to update the 'best guess' parts of the Detective notes (again - this is all in SuspectsPanel now). ...and, just as I have a really elegant and powerful system working (including an 'Unsure' option which appears whenever there are more than 2 possible suspects)... I take another look at the requirements and, well, it doesn't look like the code actually had to do anything after all.  Oh well, our code is awesome, at least.

| * Added draw functions for RoomCell and WalkwayCell, which use cellDimensions to size themselves and the BoardCell color to fill in the proper color.
| * Added panelHeight and panelWidth (with appropriate getter methods) to the Board class.  These are integer values.  There is also a cellDimensions integer variable which is used to calculate these.
| * Made an abstract method draw in BoardCell.

* filled in idea
* second attempt
* No need to clutter code with a lot of repeated calls to calcIndex.  Made a cell variable to keep track of the current cell we're looking at - since we call it so often.  It might be worth it to make 'up', 'down', 'left','right' as well, if they are used so prolifically
* sample fix for calculateAdjacencies
* ignoring log.txt
* Fixed call to nonexistant legend file.  Now only one test fails, and it fails due to a failure rather than due to crashing.
* Many renamed variables and functions (to make tests and actual code match and to clear up ambiguities).  Removed calcTargets(row,col,steps) and made setupTargets into startTargets(row,col,steps).
* renamed clueBoard package to clueGame packed per CR tests.
